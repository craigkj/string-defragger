string-recombinator
===================

Simple programming exercise from long ago found in deep dark laptop folder.

Recombines fragments of a string that are delimited by ':'. Each line of test.txt is a single test case.

**Running**

Run from the command line like... :

    cd src
    java string.recombination.StringRecombinator.java
    javac string.recombination.StringRecombinator ../test.txt

Or you could (***should***) be a bit more clever than that ;)
