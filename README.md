string-recombinator
===================

Simple programming exercise from long ago found in deep dark laptop folder...

recombines fragments of a string that are delimited by ':'. Each line of test.txt is a single test case.

Run from the command line like... :

cd src
java string.recombination.StringRecombinator.java
javac string.recombination.StringRecombinator ../test.txt

Or you could _should_ be a bit more clever than that ;)
